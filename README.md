# Leaflet-challenge Earthquake Visualization and Data Plotting
Overview
This project involves visualizing earthquake data and optionally adding tectonic plates data.

Part 1: Earthquake Visualization
I completed the following steps:

Dataset Acquisition:

I visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and chose the dataset "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days".
I used the dataset's URL to pull in the data for visualization.
Data Visualization:

Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
I included popups providing additional information about each earthquake.
I added a legend to provide context for the map data.
Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)
I completed the following enhancements:

Tectonic Plates Data:

I obtained tectonic plates data from this GitHub repository.
I plotted the tectonic plates dataset on the map alongside the earthquake data.
Additional Features:

I added other base maps to choose from.
I created separate overlays for each dataset, allowing them to be turned on and off independently.
I implemented layer controls for better map interaction.
